# Customer Support Ticket Analysis

This project analyzes customer support tickets to identify the most common issues, understand resolution time patterns, and propose process improvements using data analysis and natural language processing (NLP).

##  Objectives
- Identify the most frequently reported problems.
- Analyze resolution time across different ticket types and priorities.
- Use NLP to uncover recurring terms in customer complaints.
- Recommend actionable process improvements based on findings.

##  Tools & Libraries
- **Python** (Jupyter Notebook)
- **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for visualizations
- **NLTK & WordCloud** for text analysis

##  Project Structure
```
├── customer_support_analysis.ipynb   # Main Jupyter Notebook
├── customer_support_tickets.csv      # Sample ticket data (if public)
└── README.md                         # Project documentation
```

##  Key Features
- Bar charts for most common ticket types and resolution time.
- Word cloud for frequently used terms in ticket descriptions.
- Priority-based analysis of resolution speed.
- Summary report with actionable recommendations.

##  Summary of Findings
- Refunds, login issues, and technical problems are the most reported.
- High-priority tickets are resolved faster, but technical issues lag.
- Word cloud analysis reveals friction points like "payment", "account", and "delivery".

## Recommendations
- Automate resolution for repetitive tasks (e.g., refunds).
- Improve FAQ and support documentation.
- Enhance triaging and prioritization through smarter tagging.
